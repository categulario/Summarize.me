Summarize.me
=============

A JSON resume generator and Github summarizer using a given `resume.json` file and some Github API calls.

Yo heads up, this makes a bunch of API calls. The summary generated for Paul Irish needed about 225 requests and retrieved 400KB of data. I'm actively trying to reduce these figs.

TODO:

 - Print layout
 - Finish styling
 - Reduce api calls as mentioned
